# exam-traffic

When do exams happen? idk let's find out.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

We also use leiningen wrappers for Coffeescript, Jade, and Bower.

Check out `profile.clj` for the lowdown on dependencies.

## (Setup) Fetching data

*To get exam schedule info:*
```
$ cd data
$ python
>>> import preproc
>>> preproc.db_setup()
>>> courses = preproc.main(url=preproc.UBC_EXAM_SCHEDULE_URL)
>>> preproc.insert(courses)
>>> exit()
```

*To get building info:*

Uncomment the `/createdb` and `/fetchaddresses` routes in
`src/exam_traffic/handler.clj`.

```
$ lein ring server-headless
```

Now navigate to `localhost:3000/createdb` followed by
`localhost:3000/fetchaddresses`.

This data now lives in data/exam-schedule.sqlite, which could've been stashed in the repo,
but honestly... binaries? in my repo? tsk tsk
